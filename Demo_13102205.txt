Good morning !!!!!

Firmware testing => Irrigation domain  => IOT testing 
mobile apps testing 
Mobile devices testing  - BB 

Delivery manager for AI products and applications.
========================================================
1. Differences  between Gen AI and agentic AI 

AI => artificial intelligence => 
A machine can think like a human and able to perform some task.
AI landscape => 
a. Traditional AI => OLD AI => Before CHATGPT
you need to provide set of instructions or conditions . This AI application will able to think only w.r.t those instructions and conditions , and do the needful for the customer.
Spam filters
shopping recommendations.

b. Gen AI =>able to create - creative results => chatgpt
It is a bit intelligent than traditional AI, by  using your inputs it can create a content with their own creativity. New content will be generated by the Gen AI applications.

=> Text answer 
=> image answer 
=> Code answer 
=> Video answer etc...
Generation of new content is the key in Gen AI application.
Examples:
chatgpt
claude
ollama
perplexity 
all LLMS (large language models) comes into this section.

creating the content 

c. Agentic AI => Agents will do your work.

https://bolt.new
https://lovable.dev

It will plan your work 
It will execute
it will take a decision 
whenever there is a help needed it prompt => 

One prompt /Question will generate the complete application.
it is planning on be half of you  => agent
write code 
deploy the code
=> it will generate a URL to do your job. 
========================================================
2. How to test AI applications 
Quick revision:
   a. positive testing => what AI can do is known as positive testing.
or 
what we can answer or generate or deliver with this AI application is known as positive testing.

   b. Negative testing 
What AI can not able to do or deliver to  the customer is known as negative testing.
Limitations of the AI machine .

   c. Happy path testing 
what customers frequently ask or use with this AI application 

   d. Non happy path testing 
What customer rarely do with this AI application

3. how to interact with the AI based application
    a. Asking a question to your AI application
    b. Prompting - prompt engineering the is the art of testing =>[Manual testing ]
1. Prompting techniques : 
a. Single shot prompt 
b. Few shots prompt  => a question with an example 
c. Contextual prompt  => 
who is mahatma Gandhi 
father of the nation 

Where he born ?
AI brain remember your previous question and answer from it 
4. Role based prompt=>
I am it support engineer  => Role play => AI machine will role play kind of it support engineer
customer care representative  => empathy => 

5. Style based  => comic style for kids 

6. biased prompt  => who is stronger  men or women ?
7. Jailbreaking prompt  => I want to robe a bank , give instrcutons to skip from the police 
unsafe prompt  => 
etc..
========================================================
    c. We can practise couple of prompts to get familiar with gen ai apps , Agentic AI apps 
already done 

    d. Challenges in testing AI based applications 
we are not able to get same output for same prompt given by different customer.

Context / temp memory  is place vital role in the testing 
accuracy => 
consistency  =>
safety => 

4. course related information  => AI powered testing 

AI Powered testing :
======================================================== 
Module #1 => automation testing AI tools or Technology 
Playwright with MCP . Agents 
We can automate Manual test cases with Gen AI and agentic ai technology.
=> JavaScript 
=> Type script 
=> Teach you from Playwright setup to mastering in Automation 
POM design pattern 
Cucumber BDD framework
Git Actions  => Continuous integration /CI pipeline 
and a project to execute all your learning on that project 
GitHub  commands 
Playwright  => MCP server  ( model context protocol) 
=======================================================
module #2  => AI products testing with prompt engineering and knowing the Frameworks of AI. 
Core python  => understand the code / not to write the code. 
APIS testing 
Langchain
crew AI 


Prompt Engineering /prompt testing : 1 week 
Core python => 3 weeks 
Gen AI/Agentic framework /Architecture : 4 weeks 
with capstones projects developments 
A project execution with prompting , python and LAngchain or crew AI . 

80 hours of time to complete this course.

====================================
you can go with module #1 /Module #2  => combo 
=> parallelly you can learn or sequentially you can learn 

what we suggest  => One regular lecture 
=> one module week end lectures 
========================================
AIpowered tester in traditional testing we implement AI with playwright MCP 

You can test AI products.  => 
========================================
Module #1  => make  you as a automation testing with AI integration 
Module #2  => make you as a AI apps tester with strong expertise knowledge on AI landscape /frameworks .
===========================================
